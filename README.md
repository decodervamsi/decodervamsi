### 😎 About Me

I’m **Vamsi**, but you can call me *“the guy who silently builds cool stuff while observing the world like a mystery.”*  
From coding to content, design to development — I believe in doing it all with purpose and a little style.

✨ *Coder by logic, creator by heart — and yes, I flirt with pixels and code sometimes... 😏*
